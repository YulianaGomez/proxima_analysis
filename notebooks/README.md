1. **Energy_trajectory** 
    - Returns surrogate(orange) and target function(green) results and compares them to results of using only the target function (blue dots)
    - Specific trajectories and entire ranges can be plotted, i.e. all results for UQ 0.2
  
2. **MAE vs Interval**
    - Compares results of MAE with interval use. Results are mainly used to find best interval for a simple surrogate as Proxima consistently does not
     use a predetermined retrain interval

3. **MAE_Temperature-Bar-chart**
    - Compares methods showing MAE across temperatures
    
4. **Scatter_plot_method_comparison**
    - Compares the methods against each other by looking at the MAE and Time (uses average hf runtime as upper limit lines)
  
5.  **Speedup_bar_chart**
    - Compares times and speedups between different methodologies
    
6. **Scatter_timecomparison**
    - Corresponding colors with runs that stayed within thresholds
