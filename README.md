# Proxima method analysis
Comparing results from different surrogate model implementations
1. Proxima with a precalculated alpha - Static Proxima
2. Proxima with a dynamically calculated alpha - Dynamic Proxima
3. Simple surrogate with predetermined parameters

To use scripts:

1. Must have Python 3.XX.XX
2. `git clone git@github.com:YulianaGomez/proxima_analysis.git`
3. Load 'proxima_data' into proxima_analysis directory
4. `pip install -e .`

Directories
--------
1. [notebooks](./notebooks) -- contains 4 jupyter notebooks that graph comparisons between the methods
2. [proxima_analysis](./proxima_analysis) -- python script containing functions for data cleaning and organization
